The package provides an efficient and flexible\r\nframework for data-driven stochastic disease spread modelling that\r\nintegrates within-herd infection dynamics as continuous-time Markov\r\nchains and livestock movements between herds as scheduled events. The\r\ncore simulation solver is implemented in C and uses OpenMP (if\r\navailable) to divide work over multiple processors. The package\r\ncontains template models and can be extended with user defined models.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install the latest release on CRAN\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"SimInf\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo install the development version of `SimInf`, it's easiest to use\r\nthe devtools package:\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"stewid/SimInf\"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to use `git` and `make`\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/stewid/SimInf.git\r\n$ cd SimInf\r\n$ make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\n#### On a Debian based system\r\n\r\nBefore installing `SimInf` you need to install\r\n[The GNU Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) (GSL).\r\n\r\n\r\n```r\r\napt-get install libgsl0-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may need to do:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nsudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### On a Windows machine\r\n\r\nTo install the development version of `SimInf` you first need to\r\ndownload and install\r\n[Rtools](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)\r\n\r\n# Authors\r\n\r\n* Pavol Bauer (Uppsala University, Sweden)\r\n* Stefan Engblom (Uppsala University, Sweden)\r\n* Stefan Widgren (National Veterinary Institute, Sweden) **(Maintainer)**\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis work was financially supported by the Swedish Research Council\r\nwithin the UPMARC Linnaeus centre of Excellence (Pavol Bauer and\r\nStefan Engblom).\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThe `SimInf` package is licensed under the GPLv3.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, bug reports, forks and pull requests are\r\nappreciated.
